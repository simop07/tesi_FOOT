  abstract  = {Many health services, including cancer care, have been affected
               by the COVID-19 epidemic. This study aimed at providing a
               systematic review of the impact of the epidemic on cancer
               diagnostic tests and diagnosis worldwide. In our systematic
               review and meta-analysis, databases such as Pubmed, Proquest and
               Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published
               between January 1st, 2020 and December 12th, 2021. Observational
               studies and articles that reported data from single clinics and
               population registries comparing the number of cancer diagnostic
               tests and/or diagnosis performed before and during the pandemic,
               were included. Two pairs of independent reviewers extracted data
               from the selected studies. The weighted average of the
               percentage variation was calculated and compared between
               pandemic and pre-pandemic periods. Stratified analysis was
               performed by geographic area, time interval and study setting.
               The review was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022314314). The
               review comprised 61 articles, whose results referred to the
               period January-October 2020. We found an overall decrease of -
               37.3\% for diagnostic tests and - 27.0\% for cancer diagnosis
               during the pandemic. For both outcomes we identified a U-shaped
               temporal trend, with an almost complete recovery for the number
               of cancer diagnosis after May 2020. We also analyzed differences
               by geographic area and screening setting. We provided a summary
               estimate of the decrease in cancer diagnosis and diagnostic
               tests, during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
               delay in cancer diagnosis could lead to an increase in the
               number of avoidable cancer deaths. Further research is needed to
               assess the impact of the pandemic measures on cancer treatment
               and mortality.},
