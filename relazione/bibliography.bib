  abstract  = {Many health services, including cancer care, have been affected
               by the COVID-19 epidemic. This study aimed at providing a
               systematic review of the impact of the epidemic on cancer
               diagnostic tests and diagnosis worldwide. In our systematic
               review and meta-analysis, databases such as Pubmed, Proquest and
               Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published
               between January 1st, 2020 and December 12th, 2021. Observational
               studies and articles that reported data from single clinics and
               population registries comparing the number of cancer diagnostic
               tests and/or diagnosis performed before and during the pandemic,
               were included. Two pairs of independent reviewers extracted data
               from the selected studies. The weighted average of the
               percentage variation was calculated and compared between
               pandemic and pre-pandemic periods. Stratified analysis was
               performed by geographic area, time interval and study setting.
               The review was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022314314). The
               review comprised 61 articles, whose results referred to the
               period January-October 2020. We found an overall decrease of -
               37.3\% for diagnostic tests and - 27.0\% for cancer diagnosis
               during the pandemic. For both outcomes we identified a U-shaped
               temporal trend, with an almost complete recovery for the number
               of cancer diagnosis after May 2020. We also analyzed differences
               by geographic area and screening setting. We provided a summary
               estimate of the decrease in cancer diagnosis and diagnostic
               tests, during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
               delay in cancer diagnosis could lead to an increase in the
               number of avoidable cancer deaths. Further research is needed to
               assess the impact of the pandemic measures on cancer treatment
               and mortality.},

Carbon ions are considered an optimal candidate for cancer treatment using particles. The National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba, Japan was the first radiotherapy hospital dedicated for carbon ion treatments in the world. Since its establishment in 1994, the NIRS has pioneered this therapy with more than 69 clinical trials so far, and hundreds of ancillary projects in physics and radiobiology. In this review, we will discuss the evolution of carbon ion radiotherapy at the NIRS and some of the current and future projects in the field.},

  abstract = {Purpose
              To report on the implementation, validation and results of the first two proton therapy PBS treatments of limited amplitudes moving targets performed at our center.
              Methods and materials
              A real time optical tracking system was used to monitor the patient surface during the CT scan and treatment. This system is also able to trigger the beam during the treatment. A 4DCT (10 phases) and a Free-Breathing CT (FBCT) were used for the planning. The physician used the 4DCT for ITV delineation, while planning was performed on the FBCT. The approved plan was evaluated in two ways:-dose recalculation on each 4DCT phase.-Interplay effect evaluation: every spot was assigned to a phase according to the beam delivery time and the breathing curve of the patient. The 10 doses were then deformed and summed on the FBCT.The largest breathing amplitude recorded during 4DCT scan was used as gating safety threshold during treatment delivery. This planning and treatment workflow was then applied for two patients affected by thoracic thymoma.
              Results
              The dosimetric evaluation of the plan showed no interplay effect. The second patient showed an overdosage to the coronary and Left Anterior Descending area in the worst case scenario but it was below the constraints. Duty Cycle together with number of beam interruptions gave information about the patient compliance to the treatment: the first patient breath is stable and within thresholds, whilst the second patient had more variations, causing multiple beam interruptions.
              Conclusion
              We defined and used for two patients a protocol for the treatment of small amplitude moving targets. The planning and delivery of the treatments gave very good results in terms of coverage, OARs sparing, 4D dose evaluation of the plan and interplay effect assessment.}

  title     = {Treatment planning optimisation in proton therapy},
  author    = {McGowan, S E and Burnet, N G and Lomax, A J},
  abstract  = {The goal of radiotherapy is to achieve uniform target coverage
               while sparing normal tissue. In proton therapy, the same sources
               of geometric uncertainty are present as in conventional
               radiotherapy. However, an important and fundamental difference
               in proton therapy is that protons have a finite range, highly
               dependent on the electron density of the material they are
               traversing, resulting in a steep dose gradient at the distal
               edge of the Bragg peak. Therefore, an accurate knowledge of the
               sources and magnitudes of the uncertainties affecting the proton
               range is essential for producing plans which are robust to these
               uncertainties. This review describes the current knowledge of
               the geometric uncertainties and discusses their impact on proton
               dose plans. The need for patient-specific validation is
               essential and in cases of complex intensity-modulated proton
               therapy plans the use of a planning target volume (PTV) may fail
               to ensure coverage of the target. In cases where a PTV cannot be
               used, other methods of quantifying plan quality have been
               investigated. A promising option is to incorporate uncertainties
               directly into the optimisation algorithm. A further development
               is the inclusion of robustness into a multicriteria optimisation
               framework, allowing a multi-objective Pareto optimisation
               function to balance robustness and conformity. The question
               remains as to whether adaptive therapy can become an integral
               part of a proton therapy, to allow re-optimisation during the
               course of a patient's treatment. The challenge of ensuring that
               plans are robust to range uncertainties in proton therapy
               remains, although these methods can provide practical solutions.},

               similar doses of low-LET radiation types, probably a result of
               the condensed energy deposition pattern of high-LET radiation.
               Here, we compare high-LET $\alpha$-particle to low-LET X-ray
               irradiation and monitor double-strand break (DSB) processing.
               Live-cell microscopy was used to monitor DNA double-strand
               breaks (DSBs), marked by p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1). In
               addition, the accumulation of the endogenous 53BP1 and
               replication protein A (RPA) DSB processing proteins was analyzed
               by immunofluorescence. In contrast to $\alpha$-particle-induced
               53BP1 foci, X-ray-induced foci were resolved quickly and more
               dynamically as they showed an increase in 53BP1 protein
               accumulation and size. In addition, the number of individual
               53BP1 and RPA foci was higher after X-ray irradiation, while
               focus intensity was higher after $\alpha$-particle irradiation.
               Interestingly, 53BP1 foci induced by $\alpha$-particles
               contained multiple RPA foci, suggesting multiple individual
               resection events, which was not observed after X-ray
               irradiation. We conclude that high-LET $\alpha$-particles cause
               closely interspaced DSBs leading to high local concentrations of
               repair proteins. Our results point toward a change in DNA damage
               processing toward DNA end-resection and homologous
               recombination, possibly due to the depletion of soluble protein
               in the nucleoplasm. The combination of closely interspaced DSBs
               and perturbed DNA damage processing could be an explanation for
               the increased relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of
               high-LET $\alpha$-particles compared to X-ray irradiation.},

  abstract = {Alpha-particle emitter labeled monoclonal antibodies are being actively developed for treatment of metastatic cancer due to the high linear energy transfer (LET) and the resulting greater biological efficacy of alpha-emitters. Our knowledge of high LET particle radiobiology derives primarily from accelerated heavy ion beam studies. In heavy ion beam therapy of loco-regional tumors, the modulation of steep transition to very high LET peak as the particle approaches the end of its track (known as the Bragg peak) enables greater delivery of biologically potent radiation to the deep seated tumors while sparing normal tissues surrounding the tumor with the relatively low LET track segment part of the heavy ion beam. Moreover, fractionation of the heavy ion beam can further enhance the peak-to-plateau relative biological effectiveness (RBE) ratio. In contrast, internally delivered alpha particle radiopharmaceutical therapy lack the control of Bragg peak energy deposition and the dose rate is determined by the administered activity, alpha-emitter half-life and biological kinetics of the radiopharmaceutical. The therapeutic ratio of tumor to normal tissue is mainly achieved by tumor specific targeting of the carrier antibody. In this brief overview, we review the radiobiology of high LET radiations learned from ion beam studies and identify the features that are also applicable for the development of alpha-emitter labeled antibodies. The molecular mechanisms underlying DNA double strand break repair response to high LET radiation are also discussed.},

               entrance, and 10, 18 and 23 mm depths, corresponding to
               different positions in the SOBP. Cell survival curves were
               generated with the in vitro colony formation method and fitted
               to the linear-quadratic model. With 137Cs gamma-rays as the
               reference irradiation, the relative biological effectiveness
               (RBE) values for a surviving fraction (SF) level of 0.1 are

               dependence of RBE on depths in modulated proton beams at the 0.1
               surviving fraction level (P < 0.05). Moreover, the rise of RBEs
               significantly depended on increasing SF level or decreased
               approximately in correspondence with irradiation dose (P =
               0.0001). To maintain uniformity of radiobiological effectiveness

While heavy ions (densely ionizing radiation) are known to have an energy- and charge-dependent increased Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE), protons should not be very different from sparsely ionizing photons. A slightly increased biological effectiveness is taken into account in proton treatment planning by assuming a fixed RBE of 1.1 for the whole radiation field. However, data emerging from recent studies suggest that, for several end points of clinical relevance, the biological response is differentially modulated by protons compared to photons. In parallel, research in the field of medical physics highlighted how variations in RBE that are currently neglected might actually result in deposition of significant doses in healthy organs. This seems to be relevant in particular for normal tissues in the entrance region and for organs at risk close behind the tumor. All these aspects will be considered and discussed in this review, highlighting how a re-discussion of the role of a variable RBE in proton therapy might be well-timed.},

The combination is shown to have several advantages for the accurate description of the cell survival response at both low and very high doses and linear energy transfers (LETs), especially when compared with the classical linear–quadratic cell survival model. Interestingly, the potentially and conditionally repairable damage types also may be linked to the two major radiation damage repair pathways of eukaryotic cells, namely, nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination. In addition, the RCR model describes the interaction of low- and high-LET damage in different dose fractions more accurately than any other known model. This is of considerable importance when describing the response of tumors and normal tissues during pencil-beam scanning with light-ion beams where low- and high-LET dose fractions from the plateau and the Bragg peak can interact synergistically when being delivered quasisimultaneously. In conclusion, considering the unique biological properties of light-ion beams (compared to conventional low-LET beams), such as their increased effect on hypoxic tumors, their microdosimetric energy deposition heterogeneity, and their pencil-beam energy deposition kernels, the largest clinical advantages are obtained with medium-LET beams (≈20–50eVnm−1). This applies even for radiation-resistant tumors, at least when the goal is to maximize tumor cure with minimal adverse reactions in normal tissues.}

              dose dependence of the induction of reproductive death of cells.
              The linear term represents damage from single particle tracks and
              the quadratic term represents damage due to interaction of
              lesions from independent tracks. Differences and similarities are

              breaks. The RBE-LET relationships are correlated with local
              energy deposition in small regions of the cells. The analysis
              shows that single-track lethal damage is composed in part of a
              type of damage that is not repaired by delayed plating and is
              very strongly dependent on LET with maximum RBE values up to 20,

              hypothesized to be caused through a repair-exchange mechanism
              involving two double-strand breaks induced close together. The

Does a model of single-cell survival in vitro really correspond to clinical tissue responses? Is it applicable at very high and very low doses?

The linear-quadratic (LQ) model utilizes terms $\alpha$ (single-hit kill) and $\beta$ (two-hit kill) which correlate with low-dose killing and high-dose killing, respectively. The LQ model can be used to determine biologically equivalent doses between various dose fractionation schemes. The various survival curve parameters can be altered if irradiated cells undergo either sublethal damage repair (which is modeled with split dose experiments), potentially lethal damage repair (which is modeled with plating delay experiments), or if cells are irradiated at low or ultrahigh dose rates.

This has traditionally been accomplished in a single fraction; however, fractionated approaches involving five or fewer treatments have been delivered for larger lesions, as well as lesions in close proximity to radiosensitive structures. The clinical utilization of SRS has overwhelmingly involved photon-based sources via dedicated radiosurgery platforms (e.g., Gamma Knife® and Cyberknife®) or specialized linear accelerators. While photon-based methods have been shown to be highly effective, advancements are sought for improved dose precision, treatment duration, and radiobiologic effect, among others, particularly in the setting of repeat irradiation. Particle-based techniques (e.g., protons and carbon ions) may improve many of these shortcomings. Specifically, the presence of a Bragg Peak with particle therapy at target depth allows for marked minimization of distal dose delivery, thus mitigating the risk of toxicity to organs at risk. Carbon ions also exhibit a higher linear energy transfer than photons and protons, allowing for greater relative biological effectiveness. While the data are limited, utilization of proton radiosurgery in the setting of brain metastases has been shown to demonstrate 1-year local control rates >90%, which are comparable to that of photon-based radiosurgery. Prospective studies are needed to further validate the safety and efficacy of this treatment modality. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of clinical evidence in the use of particle therapy-based radiosurgery.},

              photon therapy Their physical depth-dose distribution in tissue
              is characterized by a small entrance dose and a distinct maximum
              (Bragg peak) near the end of range with a sharp fall-off at the
              distal edge Taking full advantage of the well-defined range and
              the small lateral beam spread, modern scanning beam systems allow

              projectiles heavier than protons such as carbon ions exhibit an
              enhanced biological effectiveness in the Bragg peak region caused

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Charged particle therapy (CPT) is currently based on the
              use of protons or carbon ions for the treatment of deep-seated
              and/or radioresistant tumors, which are known to return poor
              prognosis in photon treatments. A renovated interest has recently
              been observed in the possibility of extending the spectrum of
              ions used in CPT. The potential and limitations of different
              particle species will be discussed in this work, with special
              regard to (1)H, (4)He, (12)C, and (16)O, that is, those presently
              available in the most advanced particle therapy clinical centers.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature information has been screened,
              as well as additional analysis has been performed, aimed at the
              comparison of basic physical and biological properties of several
              ions. The research treatment planning system TRiP98 is also
              employed to compare the dose distribution resulting from exposure
              to the different ions in different configurations, including the
              irradiation of hypoxic targets. RESULTS: Particles of
              intermediate charge, such as helium and lithium, offer an
              increased physical selectivity compared with protons, while
              having reduced biological effectiveness compared with carbon. The
              latter aspect translates into a less sensitive biological
              optimization of CPT treatments, though still more effective than
              protons in killing cancer cells. At the same time, in view of
              their increased linear energy transfer, heavier ions, like
              oxygen, are considered attractive, especially for the treatment
              of hypoxic tumors. While the higher biological dose released in
              the entrance dose represents in general a drawback for ions
              heavier than carbon, for oxygen beam this effect may be balanced
              by the lower dose increase requested to overcome hypoxia.
              CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of delivering radiation
              quality-optimized CPT treatments seems to be the new challenge in
              heavy ion therapy. The potential and limitations of different
              particle species, according to different sensitivity and
              morphological scenarios, makes combined treatments of different
              ions an intriguing option. New ions could open new scenarios in
              cancer therapy, but would represent as well an opportunity for
              the treatment of specific non-cancer disease such as atrial
              fibrillation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Different ion types offer different physical and
              biological advantages for therapeutic applications. The purpose
              of this work is to assess the advantages of the most commonly
              used ions in particle therapy, i.e., carbon ((12)C), helium
              ((4)He), and protons ((1)H) for different treatment scenarios.
              METHODS: A treatment planning analysis based on idealized target
              geometries was performed using the treatment planning software
              TRiP98. For the prediction of the relative biological
              effectiveness (RBE) that is required for biological optimization
              in treatment planning the local effect model (LEM IV) was used.
              To compare the three ion types, the peak-to-entrance ratio (PER)
              was determined for the physical dose (PERPHY S), the RBE
              (PERRBE), and the RBE-weighted dose (PERBIO) resulting for
              different dose-levels, field configurations, and tissue types.
              Further, the dose contribution to artificial organs at risk (OAR)
              was assessed and a comparison of the dose distribution for the
              different ion types was performed for a patient with chordoma of
              the skull base. RESULTS: The study showed that the advantages of
              the ions depend on the physical and biological properties and the
              interplay of both. In the case of protons, the consideration of a
              variable RBE instead of the clinically applied generic RBE of 1.1
              indicates an advantage in terms of an increased PERRBE for the
              analyzed configurations. Due to the fact that protons show a
              somewhat better PERPHY S compared to helium and carbon ions
              whereas helium shows a higher PERRBE compared to protons, both
              protons and helium ions show a similar RBE-weighted dose
              distribution. Carbon ions show the largest variation of the
              PERRBE with tissue type and a benefit for radioresistant tumor
              types due to their higher LET. Furthermore, in the case of a
              two-field irradiation, an additional gain in terms of PERBIO is
              observed when using an orthogonal field configuration for carbon
              ions as compared to opposing fields. In contrast, for protons,
              the PERBIO is almost independent on the field configuration.
              Concerning the artificial lateral OAR, the volume receiving 20\%
              of the prescribed RBE-weighted dose (V20) was reduced by over
              35\% using helium ions and by over 40\% using carbon ions
              compared to protons. The analysis of the patient plan showed that
              protons, helium, and carbon ions are similar in terms of target
              coverage whereas the dose to the surrounding tissue is increasing
              from carbon ions toward protons. The mean dose to the brain stem
              can be reduced by more than 55\% when using helium ions and by
              further 25\% when using carbon ions instead of protons.
              CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of the PERRBE and PERPHY S of the
              three ion types suggests a strong dependence of the advantages of

In this manuscript, we present the analysis of the data collected in the interactions of an oxygen ion beam of 400 MeV/u with a graphite target using a partial FOOT setup, at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research facility in Darmstadt. During the data taking the magnets, the silicon trackers and the calorimeter foreseen in the final FOOT setup were not yet available, and hence precise measurements of the fragments kinetic energy, momentum and mass were not possible. However, using the FOOT scintillator detectors for the time of flight (TOF) and energy loss ($\Delta$E) measurements together with a drift chamber, used as beam monitor, it was possible to measure the elemental fragmentation cross sections. The reduced detector set-up and the limited available statistics allowed anyway to obtain relevant results, providing statistically significant measurements of cross sections eagerly needed for PT and RPS applications. Whenever possible the obtained results have been compared with existing measurements helping in discriminating between conflicting results in the literature and demonstrating at the same time the proper functioning of the FOOT $\Delta$E-TOF system. Finally, the obtained fragmentation cross sections are compared to the Monte Carlo predictions obtained with the FLUKA software.}

Outside CERN, among various applications worldwide, FLUKA serves as a core tool for the HIT and CNAO hadron-therapy facilities in Europe. Therefore, medical applications further impose stringent requirements in terms of reliability and predictive power, which demands constant refinement of sophisticated nuclear models and continuous code improvement. Some of the latest developments implemented in FLUKA are presented in this paper, with particular emphasis on issues and concerns pertaining to CERN and medical applications.}

Temperature profile of this in-house built vertical transparent Bridgman-Stockbarger technique growth furnace is optimized to grow quality single crystals of KSr2I5:Eu2+. From the photoluminescence emission spectrum a typical 4f6 5d1 – 4f7 transition is observed for a broad emission peak at 432 nm whereas a broad emission peak at 448 nm was obtained from the X-ray excited radioluminescence spectrum. The gamma ray spectrometer was administered to detect the scintillation properties of the grown crystal. The scintillation decay time was calculated for the KSr2I5:Eu2+ crystal wherein the energy resolution under 137Cs sealed gamma source is found to be 3.5 % at 662 KeV.}

  abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,143 new measurements from 709 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning, and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 23 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print, as a web version optimized for use on phones, and as an Android app.},
