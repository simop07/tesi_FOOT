  abstract  = {Many health services, including cancer care, have been affected
               by the COVID-19 epidemic. This study aimed at providing a
               systematic review of the impact of the epidemic on cancer
               diagnostic tests and diagnosis worldwide. In our systematic
               review and meta-analysis, databases such as Pubmed, Proquest and
               Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published
               between January 1st, 2020 and December 12th, 2021. Observational
               studies and articles that reported data from single clinics and
               population registries comparing the number of cancer diagnostic
               tests and/or diagnosis performed before and during the pandemic,
               were included. Two pairs of independent reviewers extracted data
               from the selected studies. The weighted average of the
               percentage variation was calculated and compared between
               pandemic and pre-pandemic periods. Stratified analysis was
               performed by geographic area, time interval and study setting.
               The review was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022314314). The
               review comprised 61 articles, whose results referred to the
               period January-October 2020. We found an overall decrease of -
               37.3\% for diagnostic tests and - 27.0\% for cancer diagnosis
               during the pandemic. For both outcomes we identified a U-shaped
               temporal trend, with an almost complete recovery for the number
               of cancer diagnosis after May 2020. We also analyzed differences
               by geographic area and screening setting. We provided a summary
               estimate of the decrease in cancer diagnosis and diagnostic
               tests, during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
               delay in cancer diagnosis could lead to an increase in the
               number of avoidable cancer deaths. Further research is needed to
               assess the impact of the pandemic measures on cancer treatment
               and mortality.},

Carbon ions are considered an optimal candidate for cancer treatment using particles. The National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba, Japan was the first radiotherapy hospital dedicated for carbon ion treatments in the world. Since its establishment in 1994, the NIRS has pioneered this therapy with more than 69 clinical trials so far, and hundreds of ancillary projects in physics and radiobiology. In this review, we will discuss the evolution of carbon ion radiotherapy at the NIRS and some of the current and future projects in the field.},

  abstract = {Purpose
              To report on the implementation, validation and results of the first two proton therapy PBS treatments of limited amplitudes moving targets performed at our center.
              Methods and materials
              A real time optical tracking system was used to monitor the patient surface during the CT scan and treatment. This system is also able to trigger the beam during the treatment. A 4DCT (10 phases) and a Free-Breathing CT (FBCT) were used for the planning. The physician used the 4DCT for ITV delineation, while planning was performed on the FBCT. The approved plan was evaluated in two ways:-dose recalculation on each 4DCT phase.-Interplay effect evaluation: every spot was assigned to a phase according to the beam delivery time and the breathing curve of the patient. The 10 doses were then deformed and summed on the FBCT.The largest breathing amplitude recorded during 4DCT scan was used as gating safety threshold during treatment delivery. This planning and treatment workflow was then applied for two patients affected by thoracic thymoma.
              Results
              The dosimetric evaluation of the plan showed no interplay effect. The second patient showed an overdosage to the coronary and Left Anterior Descending area in the worst case scenario but it was below the constraints. Duty Cycle together with number of beam interruptions gave information about the patient compliance to the treatment: the first patient breath is stable and within thresholds, whilst the second patient had more variations, causing multiple beam interruptions.
              Conclusion
              We defined and used for two patients a protocol for the treatment of small amplitude moving targets. The planning and delivery of the treatments gave very good results in terms of coverage, OARs sparing, 4D dose evaluation of the plan and interplay effect assessment.}

  title     = {Treatment planning optimisation in proton therapy},

  abstract  = {The goal of radiotherapy is to achieve uniform target coverage
               while sparing normal tissue. In proton therapy, the same sources
               of geometric uncertainty are present as in conventional
               radiotherapy. However, an important and fundamental difference
               in proton therapy is that protons have a finite range, highly
               dependent on the electron density of the material they are
               traversing, resulting in a steep dose gradient at the distal
               edge of the Bragg peak. Therefore, an accurate knowledge of the
               sources and magnitudes of the uncertainties affecting the proton
               range is essential for producing plans which are robust to these
               uncertainties. This review describes the current knowledge of
               the geometric uncertainties and discusses their impact on proton
               dose plans. The need for patient-specific validation is
               essential and in cases of complex intensity-modulated proton
               therapy plans the use of a planning target volume (PTV) may fail
               to ensure coverage of the target. In cases where a PTV cannot be
               used, other methods of quantifying plan quality have been
               investigated. A promising option is to incorporate uncertainties
               directly into the optimisation algorithm. A further development
               is the inclusion of robustness into a multicriteria optimisation
               framework, allowing a multi-objective Pareto optimisation
               function to balance robustness and conformity. The question
               remains as to whether adaptive therapy can become an integral
               part of a proton therapy, to allow re-optimisation during the
               course of a patient's treatment. The challenge of ensuring that
               plans are robust to range uncertainties in proton therapy
               remains, although these methods can provide practical solutions.},

               similar doses of low-LET radiation types, probably a result of
               the condensed energy deposition pattern of high-LET radiation.
               Here, we compare high-LET $\alpha$-particle to low-LET X-ray
               irradiation and monitor double-strand break (DSB) processing.
               Live-cell microscopy was used to monitor DNA double-strand
               breaks (DSBs), marked by p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1). In
               addition, the accumulation of the endogenous 53BP1 and
               replication protein A (RPA) DSB processing proteins was analyzed
               by immunofluorescence. In contrast to $\alpha$-particle-induced
               53BP1 foci, X-ray-induced foci were resolved quickly and more
               dynamically as they showed an increase in 53BP1 protein
               accumulation and size. In addition, the number of individual
               53BP1 and RPA foci was higher after X-ray irradiation, while
               focus intensity was higher after $\alpha$-particle irradiation.
               Interestingly, 53BP1 foci induced by $\alpha$-particles
               contained multiple RPA foci, suggesting multiple individual
               resection events, which was not observed after X-ray
               irradiation. We conclude that high-LET $\alpha$-particles cause
               closely interspaced DSBs leading to high local concentrations of
               repair proteins. Our results point toward a change in DNA damage
               processing toward DNA end-resection and homologous
               recombination, possibly due to the depletion of soluble protein
               in the nucleoplasm. The combination of closely interspaced DSBs
               and perturbed DNA damage processing could be an explanation for
               the increased relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of
               high-LET $\alpha$-particles compared to X-ray irradiation.},

  abstract = {Alpha-particle emitter labeled monoclonal antibodies are being actively developed for treatment of metastatic cancer due to the high linear energy transfer (LET) and the resulting greater biological efficacy of alpha-emitters. Our knowledge of high LET particle radiobiology derives primarily from accelerated heavy ion beam studies. In heavy ion beam therapy of loco-regional tumors, the modulation of steep transition to very high LET peak as the particle approaches the end of its track (known as the Bragg peak) enables greater delivery of biologically potent radiation to the deep seated tumors while sparing normal tissues surrounding the tumor with the relatively low LET track segment part of the heavy ion beam. Moreover, fractionation of the heavy ion beam can further enhance the peak-to-plateau relative biological effectiveness (RBE) ratio. In contrast, internally delivered alpha particle radiopharmaceutical therapy lack the control of Bragg peak energy deposition and the dose rate is determined by the administered activity, alpha-emitter half-life and biological kinetics of the radiopharmaceutical. The therapeutic ratio of tumor to normal tissue is mainly achieved by tumor specific targeting of the carrier antibody. In this brief overview, we review the radiobiology of high LET radiations learned from ion beam studies and identify the features that are also applicable for the development of alpha-emitter labeled antibodies. The molecular mechanisms underlying DNA double strand break repair response to high LET radiation are also discussed.},

               irradiation positions: 2 mm depth, corresponding to the
               entrance, and 10, 18 and 23 mm depths, corresponding to
               different positions in the SOBP. Cell survival curves were
               generated with the in vitro colony formation method and fitted
               to the linear-quadratic model. With 137Cs gamma-rays as the
               reference irradiation, the relative biological effectiveness
               (RBE) values for a surviving fraction (SF) level of 0.1 are
               1.05, 1.10, 1.12 and 1.19 for depths of 2, 10, 18 and 23 mm
               respectively. A significant difference was found between the
               survival curves at 10 and 23 mm (P < 0.05), but not between 18
               and 10 mm or between 18 and 23 mm. There was a significant
               dependence of RBE on depths in modulated proton beams at the 0.1
               surviving fraction level (P < 0.05). Moreover, the rise of RBEs
               significantly depended on increasing SF level or decreased
               approximately in correspondence with irradiation dose (P =
               0.0001). To maintain uniformity of radiobiological effectiveness
               for the target volume, careful attention should be paid to the
               influence of depth of beam and irradiation dose.},

  abstract = {In addition to the physical advantages (Bragg peak), the use of charged particles in cancer therapy can be associated with distinct biological effects compared to X-rays. While heavy ions (densely ionizing radiation) are known to have an energy- and charge-dependent increased Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE), protons should not be very different from sparsely ionizing photons. A slightly increased biological effectiveness is taken into account in proton treatment planning by assuming a fixed RBE of 1.1 for the whole radiation field. However, data emerging from recent studies suggest that, for several end points of clinical relevance, the biological response is differentially modulated by protons compared to photons. In parallel, research in the field of medical physics highlighted how variations in RBE that are currently neglected might actually result in deposition of significant doses in healthy organs. This seems to be relevant in particular for normal tissues in the entrance region and for organs at risk close behind the tumor. All these aspects will be considered and discussed in this review, highlighting how a re-discussion of the role of a variable RBE in proton therapy might be well-timed.},

  abstract  = {To accurately describe the radiation response over a wide dose and ionization density range, binomial and Poisson statistics have been combined with the recently developed potentially repairable‚Äìconditionally repairable (RCR) damage-response model. The combination is shown to have several advantages for the accurate description of the cell survival response at both low and very high doses and linear energy transfers (LETs), especially when compared with the classical linear‚Äìquadratic cell survival model. Interestingly, the potentially and conditionally repairable damage types also may be linked to the two major radiation damage repair pathways of eukaryotic cells, namely, nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination. In addition, the RCR model describes the interaction of low- and high-LET damage in different dose fractions more accurately than any other known model. This is of considerable importance when describing the response of tumors and normal tissues during pencil-beam scanning with light-ion beams where low- and high-LET dose fractions from the plateau and the Bragg peak can interact synergistically when being delivered quasisimultaneously. In conclusion, considering the unique biological properties of light-ion beams (compared to conventional low-LET beams), such as their increased effect on hypoxic tumors, their microdosimetric energy deposition heterogeneity, and their pencil-beam energy deposition kernels, the largest clinical advantages are obtained with medium-LET beams (‚âà20‚Äì50eVnm‚àí1). This applies even for radiation-resistant tumors, at least when the goal is to maximize tumor cure with minimal adverse reactions in normal tissues.}

  abstract = {The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of radiations as a
              function of linear energy transfer (LET) is analyzed for
              different types of damage causing reproductive death of mammalian
              cells. Survival curves are evaluated assuming a linear-quadratic
              dose dependence of the induction of reproductive death of cells.
              The linear term represents damage from single particle tracks and
              the quadratic term represents damage due to interaction of
              lesions from independent tracks. Differences and similarities are
              discussed of the LET dependence of single-track lethal damage,
              sublethal damage, potentially lethal damage and DNA double-strand
              breaks. The RBE-LET relationships are correlated with local
              energy deposition in small regions of the cells. The analysis
              shows that single-track lethal damage is composed in part of a
              type of damage that is not repaired by delayed plating and is
              very strongly dependent on LET with maximum RBE values up to 20,
              while another component consists of potentially lethal damage
              that is weakly dependent on LET with maximum RBE values less than
              3. Potentially lethal damage and sublethal damage depend
              similarly on LET as DNA double-strand breaks. The sector of
              single-track damage which is not repaired by delayed plating is
              hypothesized to be caused through a repair-exchange mechanism
              involving two double-strand breaks induced close together. The
              identification of these different components of damage leads to
              an interpretation of differences in radiosensitivity and in
              RBE-LET relationships among various types of cells.},
